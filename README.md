# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Developed a facial expression recognition model in Keras by training a convolutional neural network .
Trained a CNN model using data of 7 Universal Facial Expressions used in a Kaggle World Championship
Applied the model on live stream using opencv after recognizing the face using a pre-trained model
